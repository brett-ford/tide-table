## Tide Table

This notebook creates a tide table using data accessed from NOAA's API. It's set up for Cape Lookout, North Carolina, 
but can be adapted to other locations by using NOAA's URL builder, which builds a query based on selected parameters: https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api-helper/url-generator.html. 

To change the location, find the relevant station code, provided in the first box of the URL builder. For example, the code for Cape Lookout is 8656841. Station codes are suggested dynamically when you type the location.
